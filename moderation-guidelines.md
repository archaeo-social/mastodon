This document contains **draft** guidelines for the moderators of the Mastodon server at [archaeo.social](https://archaeo.social).

## Rules and guidelines for moderators
- Trending posts, hashtags and links should generally be left alone, but the following topics should be actively removed:
  - State politics
  - Topics that people generally want to avoid (e.g. twitter/musk drama, etc)
  - Non-specific fediverse tips and tricks
  -
- Block links from twitter or other major commercial social networks
- Leave follow recommendations alone
- Establish norms and protocols for immediate or expedited content removal, deciding what should be elevated to communal decisions by the mod team, the role of appeals as well as protocols for handling them
