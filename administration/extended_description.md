4. No impersonating other people
5. No harassment of any kind
6. No un-described images or video

## archaeo.social Community Standards

This is a general-purpose federated Mastodon instance. You may use it as a personal account, but the focus is on archaeology.

Real names and credentials are only recommended if you plan to use your account on this instance for networking purposes; they are absolutely not required.

## Encouraged uses of archaeo.social

- Share or summarize your publications
- Share references and resources
- Network with other archaeologists
- Put it on the last slide of your conference presentation
- Satire and activism are welcome here, but they must make a good-faith effort to punch up. ("Punching up": making jokes or criticism at the expense of those with more power, higher status or greater privilege.)

## Who is welcome on archaeo.social? Do I need to be a full-time student, teacher or researcher?

This instance is for those primarily interested in scholarly communication about archaeology. You do not need an advanced degree to join, or any degree, for that matter.

If you consider yourself an archaeologist or an archaeological enthusiast of any sort, and you are willing to engage with others respectfully, you are absolutely welcome here.

## Introduce yourself!

After signing up, post a message to the Local Timeline telling us who you are, what your archaeological interests are, and helping us to get to know you better. We have set the administrative account to automatically boost public posts tagged with #introductions.

We encourage you to upload a profile picture and include a bio in your profile to help you stand out. This is not required, but strongly recommended.

## Content Warnings (CW's)

Please add CW's (content warnings) that are accurate and descriptive enough to enable reader consent to the following types of posts:

- strong language,
- rants,
- selfies,
- current events (includes: US or non-US, local, national, international, and should be applied regardless of whether sources are academic or non-partisan),
- high-conflict or otherwise exhausting issues of popular debate (e.g. climate change, GMO's, privacy issues, elections, etc.),
- mentions of death or violence,
- photographs or illustrations of insects, genitals, wounds (even if they come from a scientific source)
- references or links to Facebook/Twitter/other big tech companies,
- spoilers of popular and recent TV shows or other media,
- ASCII art (this one is important to ensure that someone using a screen reader doesn't have to listen to an attempt to read out a bunch of obscure symbols)
- stresses particular to academia such as grades, exams, thesis progress, academic job market prospects,
- anything else where another user might want to decide for themselves whether or when they want to interact with your post, and
- images of human remains

There is a setting in your preferences to open all posts with Content Warnings automatically, if you don't want to click through each one. These kinds of posts disrupt many users' positive social experience on the web and should be treated as "opt-in" content.

## Image descriptions

It is an expectation of this instance that you add accurate descriptions to all images and video that you post to aid in accessibility.

A good image description should convey the content and the purpose of an image in a concise and unambiguous manner. It shouldnâ€™t be longer than a sentence or two, most of the time a few thoughtfully selected words will do. Consider what is important about an image. For example, important context might be the setting, the emotions on people's faces, the colors, or the relative sizes.

Do not repeat the surrounding textual content as alt text or use phrases referring to images, such as, "a graphic of" or "an image of."

If you post an image of a screenshot of text, you should transcribe the text in the image description.

## The Local Timeline

Be conscious of how much space you take up on the Local Timeline. This is the instance's "kitchen table," where we all hang out.

Posts on the Local Timeline (ones with the "Public" privacy setting) will be checked to ensure that Content Warnings are applied, images are described, and other expectations are followed. Unlisted posts will not be proactively reviewed, but will still be subject to rules regarding abuse and other hate-speech.

Make the first post of a thread Public if you want it on the Local Timeline, and subsequent posts Unlisted.

NOTE: Some Mastodon apps, including the "official" Mastodon app, do not allow for posting using the "Unlisted" privacy setting.

Use a CW or post as Unlisted if you're not sure that your post is "on-topic." The archaeo.social Local Timeline is not meant to be a current events news aggregator, and if your post seems to fall into this category, you may be asked to delete and re-draft it with a CW or as an Unlisted post. Let's try to avoid turning the Local Timeline into the same rehashing of the outrage-of-the-day that we see on Twitter!

## Things that will get your account closed, possibly without warning

- Racism, sexism, homophobia, transphobia, able-ism, etc. (will result in a permanent ban, you may not receive a prior warning)
- Serious dishonesty that is hurtful to others (e.g. falsely representing oneself as a member of a minority; services offering to write academic papers to help students cheat; vaccine denialism; predatory conferences or journals; overt pseudoscience such as flat-earther-ism etc.)
- Anything that could be described as "spam"
- Impersonating other people
- Harassment of any kind
- No bots and no "institutional" accounts operated by non-members please; archaeo.social is for people
- Accounts that automatically repeat a Twitter account, RSS feed, etc. must post to archaeo.social as Unlisted, not Public

The Local Timelime is actively moderated. Please do not hesitate to report bad behaviour and to bring such behaviour to Moderators' attention.

## Brand accounts

Brand accounts, or accounts that represent commercial, institutional, or collective entities, are allowed but must be relevant to the scope that archaeo.social has defined for itself. archaeo.social is for people, and the experiences of human users is our top priority.

## Uploaded media

Uploaded media (i.e. images and videos attached to posts) are automatically backed up through our hosting provider. However, archaeo-social is not an archive and you should not assume that anything hosted on archaeo-social servers is preserved for longevity.
