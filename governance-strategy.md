This document, created during the week after the archaeo-social mastodon instance was initiated, outlines some key tasks and decisions that need to be discussed and/or acted upon pertaining to how the instance will be managed and moderated.

## High priority
- Bring in other mods, especially queer people or people of colour
  - The scholar.social guidelines (https://scholar.social/about/more) that serve as a point of departure for our own include a lot of emphasis on being a safe space for queer people, people of colour, and members of other minority groups. We need some guidance and participation from others to live up to those standards.
- Potential for different degrees of moderation for public, unlisted, and followers-only posts
- Archaeology-specific content warnings
  - Images of human remains
  -
- General policy ideas not included in scholar.social guidelines
  - Encourage tagging calls for papers and calls for action with appropriate hashtags
  - New users should have a bio and profile pic
  -
- Initiate a call for more active community reporting of posts that break the guidelines
- Establish regular (monthly?) open meetings to discuss the state of the server, receive feedback, recruit moderators, toss around ideas, and generally get the community involved in decision making
  - Enact consensus-based decision making principles
    - https://www.seedsforchange.org.uk/shortconsensus
- Publish our guidelines and community standards on the webpage
- Establish rules and guidelines for moderators (see below)
-

## Low priority
- Set admin account to automatically boosts intro posts
- Advisory against uploading large image or video files
-

## Rules and guidelines for moderators
- Trending posts, hashtags and links should generally be left alone, but the following topics should be actively removed:
  - State politics
  - Topics that people generally want to avoid (e.g. twitter/musk drama, etc)
  - Non-specific fediverse tips and tricks
  -
- Block links from twitter or other major commercial social networks
- Leave follow recommendations alone
- Establish norms and protocols for immediate or expedited content removal, deciding what should be elevated to communal decisions by the mod team, the role of appeals as well as protocols for handling them
